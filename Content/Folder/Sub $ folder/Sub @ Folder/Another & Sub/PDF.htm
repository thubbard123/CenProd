        <h1>PDF</h1>
        <p>An open file format created by Adobe. Short for "Portable Document Format," PDF files represent two-dimensional documents in a device-independent and resolution-independent fixed-layout document format. You can generate PDF output from your project directly (as long as you have the latest version of Microsoft .NET Framework installed on your computer), or you can generate PDF output while simultaneously building FrameMaker or Word 2007 output (by installing a free add-in download from Microsoft).</p>
